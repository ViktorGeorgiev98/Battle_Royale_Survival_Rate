    "### Introduction\n",
    "Let us face it — everybody has at least once in their life played a game like PUBG, Fortnite, Call of Duty Warzone / Mobile, or something similar. \n",
    "In recent times, TV series like *Squid Game* and *Alice in Borderland* have further popularized the idea, which possibly started with the *Hunger Games* book series.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project simulates a simplified Battle Royale scenario and uses **probability theory**, **stochastic simulation**, and **statistical analysis** to estimate each player’s survival chances. \n",
    "The results help answer questions like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How does initial skill influence survival?\n",
    "- How many rounds are typically needed until only one survives?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project goals\n",
    "- Model a **simplified Battle Royale** with `N` players.\n",
    "- Implement **random encounters** between players, with probabilistic outcomes based on skill.\n",
    "- Use **Monte Carlo simulation** to estimate survival rates.\n",
    "- Apply **probability**, **combinatorics**, and **basic Markov modeling** to understand outcomes.\n",
    "- Visualize key results using graphs and plots.\n",
    "- Explore potential **strategic insights** based on survival analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methodology overview\n",
    "- Define a set of players, each with a skill rating.\n",
    "- Determine outcome of each encounter using **probabilistic rules**.\n",
    "- Repeat the process until only one player remains.\n",
    "- Run thousands of simulations to gather statistics.\n",
    "- Analyze results using probability theory and visualization.\n",

    "### 1. Player Attributes: Gender, Age and Background\n",
    "\n",
    "- Gender: This could affect the base skill (e.g., male players could have a higher average skill based on physicality in combat, while female players may have a different strategy).\n",
    "- Age: The skill of a player decreases with age, especially above 50. This could be represented as a function where the skill **S** decreases as age **A** increases\n",
    "$$S_{age}(A) = S_{base} * (1 - 0.05 * max(0, A - 50))$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This formula represents a 5% decrease in skill for every year above 50. For ages below 50, the skill remains the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Backgrounds: Different backgrounds provide different advantages, such as:\n",
    "    * Programmer: Better at strategy, with higher chance of survival when hiding or avoiding conflict.\n",
    "    * MMA Fighter: Higher combat skill, but lower strategy or survival when hiding.\n",
    "    * Soldier: Balanced in combat and survival.\n",
    "    * Doctor: Can heal or reduce injuries, improving survival chances.\n",
    "    * Construction worker: Can use equipment better\n",
    "    * Others\n",
    "\n",
    "We can model these advantages by adding background multipliers to the base skill:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "S_{\\text{background}} = S_{\\text{base}} \\times M_{\\text{background}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $M_{background}$ is a multiplier based on the background (e.g. MMA fighter $M_{MMA}$ = 1.2, Doctor $M_{doctor}$ = 1.1)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "Players can adopt different strategies during the game, which affect their survival probability. We can represent this as a conditional probability:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Aggressive strategy**:  Higher risk of death but higher chance of eliminating opponents.\n",
    "- **Hiding strategy**: Lower risk of death, but lower chance of eliminating opponents.\n",
    "- **Balanced strategy**: Mix of both\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use a strategy modifier $M_{strategy}$ that adjusts the survival probability based on the strategy:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P_{survival}(strategy) = P_{base} * M_{strategy}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $M_{strategy}$ could take values based on the strategy chosen (e.g., for aggressive: $M_{aggressive}$ = 0.8, hiding $M_{hiding}$ = 0.8)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Injuries and Sickness\n",
    "\n",
    "Injuries or sickness can decrease a player's survival probability. Let’s define a probability reduction factor $R_{injury}$ or $R_{sickness}$ based on the severity of the condition:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P_{survival} = P_{base} * (1 - R_{injury}) * (1 - R_{sickness})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "\n",
    "$R_{injury}$ and $R_{sickness}$ are factors between 0 and 1, where 1 represents a fatal injury or sickness.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Team Dynamics\n",
    "\n",
    "When players with similar backgrounds team up, they can boost each other’s survival chances. This can be modeled using a cooperative multiplier $M_{team}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P_{survival | team} = P_{base} * M_{team}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $M_{team}$ > 1 (e.g. $M_{team}$ = 1.2) if the players have compatible backgrounds (e.g., two soldiers teaming up).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Zone shrinking\n",
    "The shrinking game zone could be modeled as a deterministic function where players outside the zone die or suffer a survival penalty. If the player is outside the zone, their survival probability becomes 0, otherwise:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "$P_{survival|zone}$ = \n",
    "\\begin{cases}\n",
    "0, & \\text{if player is outside the zone} \\\\\n",
    "P_{\\text{base}}, & \\text{if player is inside the zone}\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The shrinking zone itself can be modeled with a time-dependent radius $r(t)$ where $r$ decreases as time progresses:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$r(t) = r_{0} - k * t$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $r_{0}$ is the initial radius and $k$ is the shrink rate\n",
    "\n",
    "--- \n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Weapons and Items\n",
    "\n",
    "Weapons found during the game can boost the player's skill or alter the outcome of encounters. We can model the weapon effect as a multiplier:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$S_{weapon} = S_{base} * M_{weapon}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $M_{weapon}$ is  is a multiplier based on the type of weapon (e.g., a gun might have $M_{weapon}$ = 1.5)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.Overall Survival Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "Combining all factors we get this formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P_{survival} = P_{base} * M_{age} * M_{background} * M_{strategy} * (1 - R_{injury}) * (1 - R_{sickness}) * M_{team} * M_{weapon} * P_{zone}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This formula accounts for all the factors affecting a player’s survival.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Bayesian Inference for Dynamic Updates\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Context**: As the game progresses, new information (such as injuries, encounters, weapons found) becomes available. We can use **Bayesian Inference** to update the survival probabilities dynamically as new data comes in.\n",
    "- **How to use it**:\n",
    "    * Each player has a prior survival probability $P\\frac{prior}{survival}$ based on their initial conditions (e.g., age, gender, background).\n",
    "    * As the game progresses, new observations (such as successful encounters or injuries) can be used to update the survival probability using Bayes’ Theorem:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P_{survival|data} = \\frac{P_{(data|survival)} * P_{survival}}{P_{data}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows the simulation to adjust each player's survival probability as they encounter new challenges or make progress through the game.\n"

    "# Battle Royale Survival Rate\n",
    "## Math concepts for developers final project\n",
    "**Author: Viktor Georgiev**  \n",
    "**Date: May 2025**\n",

    "### Introduction\n",
    "Let us face it — everybody has at least once in their life played a game like PUBG, Fortnite, Call of Duty Warzone / Mobile, or something similar. \n",
    "In recent times, TV series like *Squid Game* and *Alice in Borderland* have further popularized the idea, which possibly started with the *Hunger Games* book series.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project simulates a simplified Battle Royale scenario and uses **probability theory**, **stochastic simulation**, and **statistical analysis** to estimate each player’s survival chances. \n",
    "The results help answer questions like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How does initial skill influence survival?\n",
    "- How many rounds are typically needed until only one survives?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project goals\n",
    "- Model a **simplified Battle Royale** with `N` players.\n",
    "- Implement **random encounters** between players, with probabilistic outcomes based on skill.\n",
    "- Use **Monte Carlo simulation** to estimate survival rates.\n",
    "- Apply **probability**, **combinatorics**, and **basic Markov modeling** to understand outcomes.\n",
    "- Visualize key results using graphs and plots.\n",
    "- Explore potential **strategic insights** based on survival analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methodology overview\n",
    "- Define a set of players, each with a skill rating.\n",
    "- Determine outcome of each encounter using **probabilistic rules**.\n",
    "- Repeat the process until only one player remains.\n",
    "- Run thousands of simulations to gather statistics.\n",
    "- Analyze results using probability theory and visualization.\n",
    "- Make statistical analysis\n",

    "### 1. Player Attributes: Gender, Age and Background\n",
    "\n",
    "- Gender: This could affect the base skill (e.g., male players could have a higher average skill based on physicality in combat, while female players may have a different strategy).\n",
    "- Age: The skill of a player decreases with age, especially above 50. This could be represented as a function where the skill **S** decreases as age **A** increases\n",
    "$$S_{age}(A) = S_{base} * (1 - 0.05 * max(0, A - 50))$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This formula represents a 5% decrease in skill for every year above 50. For ages below 50, the skill remains the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Backgrounds: Different backgrounds provide different advantages, such as:\n",
    "    * Programmer: Better at strategy, with higher chance of survival when hiding or avoiding conflict.\n",
    "    * MMA Fighter: Higher combat skill, but lower strategy or survival when hiding.\n",
    "    * Soldier: Balanced in combat and survival.\n",
    "    * Doctor: Can heal or reduce injuries, improving survival chances.\n",
    "    * Construction worker: Can use equipment better\n",
    "    * Others\n",
    "\n",
    "We can model these advantages by adding background multipliers to the base skill:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "S_{\\text{background}} = S_{\\text{base}} \\times M_{\\text{background}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "Players can adopt different strategies during the game, which affect their survival probability. We can represent this as a conditional probability:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Aggressive strategy**:  Higher risk of death but higher chance of eliminating opponents.\n",
    "- **Hiding strategy**: Lower risk of death, but lower chance of eliminating opponents.\n",
    "- **Balanced strategy**: Mix of both\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use a strategy modifier $M_{strategy}$ that adjusts the survival probability based on the strategy:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P_{survival}(strategy) = P_{base} * M_{strategy}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $M_{strategy}$ could take values based on the strategy chosen (e.g., for aggressive: $M_{aggressive}$ = 0.8, hiding $M_{hiding}$ = 0.8)\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Injuries and Sickness\n",
    "\n",
    "Injuries or sickness can decrease a player's survival probability. Let’s define a probability reduction factor $R_{injury}$ or $R_{sickness}$ based on the severity of the condition:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P_{survival} = P_{base} * (1 - R_{injury}) * (1 - R_{sickness})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "\n",
    "$R_{injury}$ and $R_{sickness}$ are factors between 0 and 1, where 1 represents a fatal injury or sickness.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Team Dynamics\n",
    "\n",
    "When players with similar backgrounds team up, they can boost each other’s survival chances. This can be modeled using a cooperative multiplier $M_{team}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P_{survival | team} = P_{base} * M_{team}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $M_{team}$ > 1 (e.g. $M_{team}$ = 1.2) if the players have compatible backgrounds (e.g., two soldiers teaming up).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Zone shrinking\n",
    "The shrinking game zone could be modeled as a deterministic function where players outside the zone die or suffer a survival penalty. If the player is outside the zone, their survival probability becomes 0, otherwise:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "$P_{survival|zone}$ = \n",
    "\\begin{cases}\n",
    "0, & \\text{if player is outside the zone} \\\\\n",

    "The shrinking zone itself can be modeled with a time-dependent radius $r(t)$ where $r$ decreases as time progresses:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$r(t) = r_{0} - k * t$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $r_{0}$ is the initial radius and $k$ is the shrink rate\n",
    "\n",
    "--- \n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Weapons and Items\n",
    "\n",
    "Weapons found during the game can boost the player's skill or alter the outcome of encounters. We can model the weapon effect as a multiplier:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$S_{weapon} = S_{base} * M_{weapon}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $M_{weapon}$ is  is a multiplier based on the type of weapon (e.g., a gun might have $M_{weapon}$ = 1.5)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.Overall Survival Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "Combining all factors we get this formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P_{survival} = P_{base} * M_{age} * M_{background} * M_{strategy} * (1 - R_{injury}) * (1 - R_{sickness}) * M_{team} * M_{weapon} * P_{zone}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This formula accounts for all the factors affecting a player’s survival.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Bayesian Inference for Dynamic Updates\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Context**: As the game progresses, new information (such as injuries, encounters, weapons found) becomes available. We can use **Bayesian Inference** to update the survival probabilities dynamically as new data comes in.\n",
    "- **How to use it**:\n",
    "    * Each player has a prior survival probability $P\\frac{prior}{survival}$ based on their initial conditions (e.g., age, gender, background).\n",
    "    * As the game progresses, new observations (such as successful encounters or injuries) can be used to update the survival probability using Bayes’ Theorem:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P_{survival|data} = \\frac{P_{(data|survival)} * P_{survival}}{P_{data}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows the simulation to adjust each player's survival probability as they encounter new challenges or make progress through the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, this is how it is going to function inside the final player class:\n",
    "Everything is left to chance, so we are going to use a random number each time the player is updated between 0 and 1.\n",
    "- If below 0.2 => add injury\n",
    "- If below 0.1 => add sickness\n",
    "- If player does not have weapon and number is below 0.15 => add weapon\n",
    "- If number is above 0.5 => player gets to be part of a team to increase survival chance for now\n",
    "\n",
    "All these stats will make an impact and change the overall survival chance of the player for better or worse\n",

    "- **Mean survival chance of 0.0091**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    This value represents the average probability that any randomly chosen player will survive until the end of the game across all simulations. It is very close to the theoretical probability of 0.01 (1/100), which makes sense because there is only one winner out of 100 players in each simulation. This close match shows that the simulation accurately reflects the expected outcome based on simple probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **The very low standard deviation confirms**:\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    The standard deviation measures how much the survival chances vary between the 100 repeated experiments. A very low value means that the survival probabilities are very consistent and don’t fluctuate much from one experiment to another. This indicates the simulation results are stable and reliable, and the model produces reproducible outcomes.\n",
    "- **The tight confidence interval and small range (min/max)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    The confidence interval shows the range within which the true average survival probability likely lies, with a high degree of certainty. The narrow confidence interval and the small difference between the minimum and maximum observed survival chances across experiments demonstrate that the results have converged well. In other words, running more simulations would likely not change the average survival probability significantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Slight negative skewness suggests**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Skewness measures the asymmetry of the distribution of survival probabilities. A slight negative skewness means the distribution leans a bit toward higher survival chances — there are somewhat more instances where players survive slightly better than the average predicted probability. This suggests that in some simulations, players have a small advantage or “luck” that slightly improves their chances of survival compared to a perfectly balanced system.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Near-zero kurtosis**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Kurtosis describes the “peakedness” or “flatness” of the distribution relative to a normal (bell-shaped) distribution. A kurtosis close to zero means that the shape of the survival probability distribution is very similar to a normal distribution, without heavy tails or extreme outliers. This indicates the variation in survival chances is typical and well-behaved, making the simulation results statistically robust.\n",

    "#### Interpretation of Simulation Results\n",
    "After running **100 batches of 1000 simulations each**, with **100 players per simulation**, we obtained the following aggregated statistics:\n",
    "- Mean survival chance of a random player: 0.0091\n",
    "\n",
    "These results are remarkably close to the theoretical expectation of $\\frac{1}{100} = 0.01$, which is the survival probability in a system where each player has equal chance of being the last survivor. The very low variance and tightly bound distribution indicate a stable **simulation**. \n",
    "\n",
    "All other statistical analyses show normal values with no abnormal behaviour. We can say that our tests are stable and make the following summary of the results:\n",

    "- Suggest the simulation is working properly\n",

    "Further analysis of the simulation outcomes revealed non-uniform survival trends among different player profiles. Specifically:\n",
    "- Players with professions like **programmers** or **doctors** who chose the **\"hiding\" or \"balanced\"** strategy tended to have a higher-than-average survival chance.\n",
    "- Conversely, players with a **combat-oriented background (such as fighters or soldiers)** who selected **\"aggressive\" or \"balanced\"** strategies also showed improved survival outcomes.\n",

    "These results are **consistent with realistic expectations**:\n",
    "- Hiding/Balanced Strategy **(Programmers/Doctors)**:\n",
    "    * These players often avoid direct conflict.\n",
    "    * As \"clever\" individuals, they may be better at resource management, evasion, and using terrain or situations to survive longer.\n",
    "    * The hiding strategy works especially well in early and mid-game stages, allowing them to outlive many competitors without needing to win fights.\n",
    "- Aggressive/Balanced Strategy (Fighters/Soldiers):\n",
    "    * Players with combat training are more likely to win direct encounters.\n",
    "    * The aggressive/balanced strategy, when paired with combat experience, allows them to actively eliminate threats and control resource-rich zones.\n",

    "Despite the overall fairness (as reflected by the near-uniform average survival rate), these emergent advantages suggest the simulation has **realistic depth**. Rather than hard-coding winners, it allows for **probabilistic advantages** that emerge based on **synergy between player traits and strategies**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This emergent behavior mimics real-world systems where:\n",
    "- Intelligence and caution can be powerful defensive tools.\n",
    "- Combat skills provide offensive power that can dominate if used properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Suggested Future Work\n",
    "In future iterations, it may be interesting to:\n",
    "- Track and visualize **per-strategy** and **per-background** win rates.\n",
    "- Introduce **adaptive strategies** (e.g., switching from hiding to aggressive as player count drops).\n",
    "- Model **collaboration and betrayal dynamics** among similar players (e.g., doctors forming teams and later turning on each other).\n",
